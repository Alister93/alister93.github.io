			<!--The systemic relations of the Old Testament variety of religious discourse (reconstructed on the basis of the Book of Psalms, the King James Version and the Russian Synodal translations, with occasional insights into the Hebrew original) were studied through the analysis of the key concepts and the most frequent <b>linguostylistic means</b> of their verbalization. The research methodology is based on qualitative approaches drawing from sociolinguistics, religious, cultural, and cognitive studies.-->  
			The dissertation attempts at reconstructing the systemic relations of the Old Testament (OT) religious discourse (RD) in the Book of Psalms (using the King James Version and the Russian Synodal translations of the Bible, with occasional insights into the Hebrew original). The systemic network was studied by analyzing the <b>key concepts</b> and the most frequently occurring <b>linguostylistic means</b> of their verbalization. The research methodology is based on the theoretical framework introduced by Vladimir Karasik (the Volgograd sociolinguistic school), with multidisciplinary methods drawing on sociolinguistic, social, historical, cognitive, cultural, and religious studies. The results were obtained through qualitative research involving <b>discourse, genre, cognitive, content, stylistic</b> and <b>poetic analyses.</b>

			<!--One of the most challenging aspects of investigating religious discourse is imbalance between its transcendental content and the rationality of human language. The findings have proven strict semiotic arrangement and clearly defined correlation of its cognitive and verbal devices. The components of the key concepts, the norms and values, the main systemic strategy, its tactics and the chronotopos (spatiotemporal features termed by M. M. Bakhtin) form a systemic framework for a respective religious worldview. In addition to the institutionality typical of any religious discourse, the Old Testament variety is distinctive in its high <b>theocentricity, text-centeredness</b>, and verbally explicit <b>enthnocultural</b> and <b>religious identification markers</b>. The Old Testament discourse is interwoven with intertextual and interdiscursive elements (of existential, spiritual, and esthetic discourses).-->
			The transcendental nature of religious nature entailing the high abstractedness of its key concepts is one of the major challenges of studying RD. Translation variables were intentionally omitted from the research focus, since the ‘text/semiotic invariant’ of the Book of Psalms was prioritized.

			<!-- Regularly recurring expressive means and stylistic devices at all linguistic levels verbalize the key concepts and their interrelations. Repetition in all its varieties (of which <b>syntactic parallelism</b> is the most common) is the major stylistic and structural factor performing mnemonic, suggestive, didactic, persuasive, and ideological functions. On the lexical-semantic level, <b>somatic synecdoches</b> with reverse metaphors and extended personifications play a pivotal role, indicative of man and God’s close relationship. The <b>didactic</b> strategy can be considered as the main system-forming strategy of the studied variety of religious discourse, being realized through the tactics of stigmatizing evaluation, exaggeration, rational argumentation, distancing, appealing to authority, and persistent repetition. It is largely aimed at teaching religious wisdoms and imparting sociocultural values.   -->  
			The genre classification of Psalms revealed their <em>emotional</em> (lamentations, complaints, praises, gratitude), <em>didactic</em> (retrospective, instructional) and <em>hybrid</em> types.     
		 </p>

		 <p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
			<!--The norms and values of religious discourse fall into four major groups: supermoral (man – God), moral (man – another man), utilitarian (man – him-/herself), subutilitarian (survival). The chronotopos is characterized by structurally arranged spatial concepts and a complex temporal system, where the linear time of institutional religious discourse is integrated with the reversible time of artistic and spiritual discourses (e.g., in retrospective psalms). -->  
			The research findings proved strict semiotic arrangement and distinct correlation of regularly-occurring cognitive and verbal devices in the studied RD. The key concepts, norms and values, the system-forming strategy, the <em>chronotope</em> (spatiotemporal features termed by Mikhail Bakhtin) as well as their interrelations create the intricate systemic framework of the religious worldview in the Book of Psalms.

		 <p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
			 <!--The script macroconcept <b>‘faith’</b> is the main concept of religious discourse, which in the Old Testament consists of four constantly developing and deploying basic frame concepts: superagent (God), <b>agents</b> (patriarchs, prophets, priests), <b>clients</b> (‘the righteous’ and ‘the wicked’, plants and animals, inanimate objects), and <b>Old Testament Judaism</b>. These frame concepts indicate overlapping and interpenetration of various (including polar) worlds and forms of symbolic existence. The <b>superagent</b> is the most complex frame macroconcept due to its multi-layered structure and extremely high abstractness. It is represented by a great number of anthropomorphic and socially significant images (e.g., ‘king’, ‘judge’, ‘warrior’, ‘vine gardener’, ‘plowman’, ‘shepherd’, ‘bridegroom’ as well as the implicit image of ‘mother bird’).-->    
			 In addition to <em>institutionality</em> typical of any RD, the studied OT variety is distinctive in its high <b>theocentricity, text-centeredness,</b> and explicitly recurring <b>ethnocultural</b> and <b>religious identification markers.</b> The conceptual structure of the OT discourse abounds in intertextual and interdiscursive components (existential, spiritual, and esthetic discourses).      
		 </p>

		 <p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
			 <!--This representation indicates that the cognitive and linguistic worldview in the Old Testament variety of religious discourse reconstructed on the Book of Psalms is <b>anthropocentric</b> and <b>activity-centered</b>, with rigid systemic relations. -->  
			 Regularly occurring multi-level rhetorical devices verbalize the key concepts and their interrelations. Repetition in all its varieties (of which <b>syntactic parallelism</b> is the most common) tends to be the key structural and stylistic feature performing mnemonic, ritual, suggestive, didactic, persuasive, and ideological functions. At the lexico-sematic level, <b>somatic synecdoches</b> with reverse metaphors and extended personifications reveal man and God’s close relationships and manifest the inclusion of interpersonal discourse. A <b>didactic strategy</b> is the underlying system-forming strategy of the studied RD. Its tactics include <em>stigmatizing evaluation, exaggeration, rational argumentation, distancing, appealing to authority,</em> and <em>persistent repetition.</em> It is principally aimed at teaching wisdoms and imparting sociocultural values.      
		 </p>

		 <p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
		 	In Karasik’s (2006) classification, the RD <b>values and norms</b> fall into the following groups:
		 	 </p>

		 	 <p>
		<table id="syn" style="width:100%">
			<tr>
				<th colspan="4">Values and norms in religious discourse</th>
				<tr>
					<th>supermoral</th>
					<th>moral</th>
					<th>utilitarian</th>
					<th>sub-utilitarian</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>man – God</td>
					<td>man – another man</td>
					<td>man – oneself</td>
					<td>survival needs</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</p>

<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
		 	Many key concepts of the OT discourse have proven their <em>interdiscursive</em> nature. In the so-called retrospective psalms, the chronotope marked by artfully arranged spatial concepts occurs inside a complex temporal system, where the linear time of the institutional discourse is closely interwoven with the reversible time of the artistic and spiritual discourses.
		 	 </p>

		 	 <p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
		 	According to Karasik (2006), the <em>script-type macroconcept</em> <b>‘faith’</b> is the <b>main concept</b> of RD. As the research findings indicate, it consists of the four continuously deploying and evolving frame-type concepts in the OT discourse:
		 	 </p>

		 	 <p>
		<table id="syn" style="width:100%">
			<tr>
				<th colspan="4">Basic frame concepts in the Old Testament discourse</th>
				<tr>
					<th>‘Super-agent’</th>
					<th>‘agents’</th>
					<th>‘clients’</th>
					<th>‘OT Judaism’</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>God</td>
					<td>patriarchs, prophets, priests (intermediaries)</td>
					<td>‘the righteous’ and ‘the wicked’, plants and animals, inanimate objects (creations)</td>
					<td>a system of beliefs</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</p>

		<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
		 	These frame concepts reveal continuous overlapping and interpenetration of various (including polar) worlds and forms of symbolic existence. The <b>‘Super-agent’</b> appears to be the most complex and multifaceted macro-concept due to its multi-layered structure and a high degree of abstractedness. It finds its symbolic representation in numerous explicit anthropomorphic and socially significant images (<em>‘king’, ‘judge’, ‘warrior’, ‘vine gardener’, ‘plowman’, ‘shepherd’, ‘bridegroom’</em>) and, interestingly, an implicit <em>‘mother bird’</em>.
		 	 </p>

		 	 <p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
		 	The discovered systemic relations bind together the key concepts, actors, chronotope, goals, values, norms, strategies, and tactics through the intricate patchwork of their recurrent cognitive and linguopoetic manifestations. By so doing, these intertextual and interdiscursive relations (re-)create and reinforce the highly ritualistic <b>anthropocentric</b> and <b>activity-centered</b> conceptual worldview in the studied RD reconstructed through the oldest English and Russian translations of the Book of Psalms.
