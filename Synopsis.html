		  <h1>Brief Synopsis of Research</h1>
		  <p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">The primary <b>research aim</b> of the dissertation is to reconstruct the systemic relations characterising the Old Testament variety of the religious discourse within the Book of Psalms. The <b>research objectives</b> include analysing high-frequency <em>core concepts</em> and their <em>linguostylistic manifestations</em> to uncover the structural and functional dynamics of this discourse. The study utilizes texts from the King James Version, the Russian Synodal translation and the Leningrad Codex of the Hebrew Bible.
		  	</p>
<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">A significant challenge in studying religious discourse lies in the transcendental nature of religious knowledge and the inherently abstract character of its core concepts. To maintain focus, translation variables were deliberately excluded from the score of the research. Instead, priority was given to exploring the ‘text/semiotic invariant’ of the Book of Psalms, ensuring a consistent analytical framework across the studied texts. 
	</p>
<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
The <b>research methodology</b> is grounded in the theoretical framework developed by Vladimir Karasik, representing the Volgograd sociolinguistic school. A multidisciplinary approach was employed, integrating methods from sociolinguistics, social sciences, cognitive studies, cultural studies and religious studies. The findings were derived through qualitative research, utilising discourse, genre, cognitive, content, stylistic and poetic analyses.
	</p>
<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
	The Psalms were classified thematically and generically into three main categories: <em>emotional</em> (including lamentations, complaints, praises and expressions of gratitude), <em>didactic</em> (comprising “royal”, retrospective and instructional psalms) and <em>hybrid</em> varieties that combine features of both. 
</p>
<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">The <b>research findings</b> reveal a rigid semiotic structure and a distinct correlation of recurring cognitive and verbal devices within the studied religious discourse. The core concepts, norms and values, alongside the key semiotic strategy and its associated tactics, the Bakhtinian chronotope and their interrelations, collectively form the intricate systemic framework of the religious worldview as expressed in the Book of Psalms.
</p>
<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">In addition to the institutional characteristics typical of any religious discourse, the studied Old Testament variety is distinguished by its pronounced <em>theocentricity, text-centeredness</em> and clearly defined <em>ethnocultural</em> and <em>religious identity markers</em>. The conceptual structure of this religious discourse is heterogeneous, interwoven with intertextual and interdiscursive elements from existential, spiritual and aesthetic discourses. 
	</p>
<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">The <em>core concepts</em> and their interconnections are expressed through regularly occurring rhetorical devices at various linguistic levels. Repetition, in all its varieties (with <b>syntactic parallelism</b> being the most common), serves as a predominant stylistic and structural factor, performing mnemonic, suggestive, didactic, persuasive and ideological functions. At the lexico-sematic level, <b>somatic synecdoches</b>, reverse metaphors and extended personifications play a pivotal role in revealing the intimate relationship between man and God. The <b>didactic strategy</b> can be considered the foundational system-forming strategy of the studied discourse. Its tactics include <em>stigmatising evaluation, exaggeration, rational argumentation, distancing, appeals to authority</em> and <em>persistent repetition</em>. The primary aim of the didactic strategy is to teach moral insights and instill certain transcendent and sociocultural values. 
	</p>
	<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">In Karasik’s (2006) classification, the values and norms of religious discourse are categorised into the following groups:
		</p>
<p>
		<table id="syn" style="width:100%">
			<tr>
				<th colspan="4">Values and norms in RD</th>
				<tr>
					<th>supermoral</th>
					<th>moral</th>
					<th>utilitarian</th>
					<th>sub-utilitarian</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>individual – God</td>
					<td>individual – another individual</td>
					<td>individual – oneself</td>
					<td>survival needs</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</p>
<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Many core concepts within the Old Testament discourse are found to be <em>interdiscursive</em>. In retrospective psalms, the chronotope, composed of artfully arranged spatial concepts, operates within a complex temporal system. Notably, the linear time of the institutional religious discourse is closely intertwined with the reversible time characteristic of both ‘artistic’ and ‘spiritual’ discourses.
	</p>
	<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">According to Karasik (2006), the <em>script-type macroconcept</em> ‘<b>faith</b>’ is identified as the <b>central concept</b> of religious discourse. Our findings reveal that it comprises four continuously evolving frame-type concepts within the religious discourse of the Old Testament.
	</p>
<p>
		<table id="syn" style="width:100%">
			<tr>
				<th colspan="4">Frame concepts in religious discourse</th>
				<tr>
					<th>Super-Agent</th>
					<th>Agents</th>
					<th>Recipients</th>
					<th>Old Testament Religion</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>God</td>
					<td>patriarchs, prophets, priests</td>
					<td>‘the righteous’ and ‘the wicked’, plants and animals, inanimate objects</td>
					<td>a system of beliefs</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</p>
<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">These frame concepts reflect continuous overlapping and interpenetration of various, including polar, worlds and forms of symbolic existence. The Super-Agent emerges as the most complex and multifaceted macroconcept due to its multi-layered structure and high degree of abstractness. It is symbolically represented through a wide array of explicit anthropomorphic and socially significant images: <em>‘king’, ‘judge’, ‘warrior’, ‘vine gardener’, ‘plowman’, ‘shepherd’, ‘bridegroom’</em> and, notably, an implicit <em>‘mother bird’</em>.
	</p>
	<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">The results of the study demonstrate clearly marked systemic relations within the <b>anthropocentric</b> and <b>activity-centered</b> conceptual worldview of the Old Testament religious discourse, as reconstructed through the oldest English and Russian translations of the Book of Psalms. These intertextual and interdiscursive relations, which connect core concepts, actors, chronotope, goals, values and norms, strategies and tactics through their regularly recurring linguistic and poetic manifestations, construct an intricate network of the studied religious discourse, (re-)creating and reinforcing its highly ritualistic and didactic structure.

			The dissertation attempts at reconstructing the systemic relations of the Old Testament (OT) religious discourse (RD) in the Book of Psalms (using the King James Version and the Russian Synodal translations of the Bible, with occasional insights into the Hebrew original). The systemic network was studied by analyzing the <b>key concepts</b> and the most frequently occurring <b>linguostylistic means</b> of their verbalization. The research methodology is based on the theoretical framework introduced by Vladimir Karasik (the Volgograd sociolinguistic school), with multidisciplinary methods drawing on sociolinguistic, social, historical, cognitive, cultural, and religious studies.

			One of the most challenging aspects of investigating religious discourse is imbalance between its transcendental content and the rationality of human language. The findings have proven strict semiotic arrangement and clearly defined correlation of its cognitive and verbal devices. The components of the key concepts, the norms and values, the main systemic strategy, its tactics and the chronotopos (spatiotemporal features termed by M. M. Bakhtin) form a systemic framework for a respective religious worldview. In addition to the institutionality typical of any religious discourse, the Old Testament variety is distinctive in its high <b>theocentricity, text-centeredness</b>, and verbally explicit <b>enthnocultural</b> and <b>religious identification markers</b>. The Old Testament discourse is interwoven with intertextual and interdiscursive elements (of existential, spiritual, and esthetic discourses).
			The transcendental nature of religious nature entailing the high abstractedness of its key concepts is one of the major challenges of studying RD. Translation variables were intentionally omitted from the research focus, since the ‘text/semiotic invariant’ of the Book of Psalms was prioritized.        
		 </p>

		 <p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
			Regularly recurring expressive means and stylistic devices at all linguistic levels verbalize the key concepts and their interrelations. Repetition in all its varieties (of which <b>syntactic parallelism</b> is the most common) is the major stylistic and structural factor performing mnemonic, suggestive, didactic, persuasive, and ideological functions. On the lexical-semantic level, <b>somatic synecdoches</b> with reverse metaphors and extended personifications play a pivotal role, indicative of man and God’s close relationship. The <b>didactic</b> strategy can be considered as the main system-forming strategy of the studied variety of religious discourse, being realized through the tactics of stigmatizing evaluation, exaggeration, rational argumentation, distancing, appealing to authority, and persistent repetition. It is largely aimed at teaching religious wisdoms and imparting sociocultural values.   
			The genre classification of Psalms revealed their <em>emotional</em> (lamentations, complaints, praises, gratitude), <em>didactic</em> (retrospective, instructional) and <em>hybrid</em> types.     
		 </p>

		 <p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
			The norms and values of religious discourse fall into four major groups: supermoral (man – God), moral (man – another man), utilitarian (man – him-/herself), subutilitarian (survival). The chronotopos is characterized by structurally arranged spatial concepts and a complex temporal system, where the linear time of institutional religious discourse is integrated with the reversible time of artistic and spiritual discourses (e.g., in retrospective psalms).
			The research findings proved strict semiotic arrangement and distinct correlation of regularly-occurring cognitive and verbal devices in the studied RD. The key concepts, norms and values, the system-forming strategy, the <em>chronotope</em> (spatiotemporal features termed by Mikhail Bakhtin) as well as their interrelations create the intricate systemic framework of the religious worldview in the Book of Psalms.       
		 </p>

		 <p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
			 The script macroconcept <b>‘faith’</b> is the main concept of religious discourse, which in the Old Testament consists of four constantly developing and deploying basic frame concepts: superagent (God), <b>agents</b> (patriarchs, prophets, priests), <b>clients</b> (‘the righteous’ and ‘the wicked’, plants and animals, inanimate objects), and <b>Old Testament Judaism</b>. These frame concepts indicate overlapping and interpenetration of various (including polar) worlds and forms of symbolic existence. The <b>superagent</b> is the most complex frame macroconcept due to its multi-layered structure and extremely high abstractness. It is represented by a great number of anthropomorphic and socially significant images (e.g., ‘king’, ‘judge’, ‘warrior’, ‘vine gardener’, ‘plowman’, ‘shepherd’, ‘bridegroom’ as well as the implicit image of ‘mother bird’).   
			 In addition to <em>institutionality</em> typical of any RD, the studied OT variety is distinctive in its high <b>theocentricity, text-centeredness,</b> and explicitly recurring <b>ethnocultural</b> and <b>religious identification markers.</b> The conceptual structure of the OT discourse abounds in intertextual and interdiscursive components (existential, spiritual, and esthetic discourses).      
		 </p>

		 <p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
			 This representation indicates that the cognitive and linguistic worldview in the Old Testament variety of religious discourse reconstructed on the Book of Psalms is <b>anthropocentric</b> and <b>activity-centered</b>, with rigid systemic relations.
			 Regularly occurring multi-level rhetorical devices verbalize the key concepts and their interrelations. Repetition in all its varieties (of which <b>syntactic parallelism</b> is the most common) tends to be the key structural and stylistic feature performing mnemonic, ritual, suggestive, didactic, persuasive, and ideological functions. At the lexico-sematic level, <b>somatic synecdoches</b> with reverse metaphors and extended personifications reveal man and God’s close relationships and manifest the inclusion of interpersonal discourse. A <b>didactic strategy</b> is the underlying system-forming strategy of the studied RD. Its tactics include <em>stigmatizing evaluation, exaggeration, rational argumentation, distancing, appealing to authority,</em> and <em>persistent repetition.</em> It is principally aimed at teaching wisdoms and imparting sociocultural values.      
		 </p>

		 <p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
		 	In Karasik’s (2006) classification, the RD <b>values and norms</b> fall into the following groups:
		 	 </p>

		 	 <p>
		<table id="syn" style="width:100%">
			<tr>
				<th colspan="4">Values and norms in religious discourse</th>
				<tr>
					<th>supermoral</th>
					<th>moral</th>

					<th>sub-utilitarian</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>man – God</td>
					<td>man – another man</td>
					<td>man – oneself</td>
					<td>survival needs</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</p>

<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
		 	Many key concepts of the OT discourse have proven their <em>interdiscursive</em> nature. In the so-called retrospective psalms, the chronotope marked by artfully arranged spatial concepts occurs inside a complex temporal system, where the linear time of the institutional discourse is closely interwoven with the reversible time of the artistic and spiritual discourses.
		 	 </p>

		 	 <p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
		 	According to Karasik (2006), the <em>script-type macroconcept</em> <b>‘faith’</b> is the <b>main concept</b> of RD. As the research findings indicate, it consists of the four continuously deploying and evolving frame-type concepts in the OT discourse:
		 	 </p>

		 	 <p>
		<table id="syn" style="width:100%">
			<tr>
				<th colspan="4">Basic frame concepts in the Old Testament discourse</th>
				<tr>
					<th>‘Super-agent’</th>
					<th>‘agents’</th>
					<th>‘clients’</th>
					<th>‘OT Judaism’</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>God</td>
					<td>patriarchs, prophets, priests (intermediaries)</td>
					<td>‘the righteous’ and ‘the wicked’, plants and animals, inanimate objects (creations)</td>
					<td>a system of beliefs</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</p>

		<p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
		 	These frame concepts reveal continuous overlapping and interpenetration of various (including polar) worlds and forms of symbolic existence. The <b>‘Super-agent’</b> appears to be the most complex and multifaceted macro-concept due to its multi-layered structure and a high degree of abstractedness. It finds its symbolic representation in numerous explicit anthropomorphic and socially significant images (<em>‘king’, ‘judge’, ‘warrior’, ‘vine gardener’, ‘plowman’, ‘shepherd’, ‘bridegroom’</em>) and, interestingly, an implicit <em>‘mother bird’</em>.
		 	 </p>

		 	 <p id="synopsis" style="text-indent: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
		 	The discovered systemic relations bind together the key concepts, actors, chronotope, goals, values, norms, strategies, and tactics through the intricate patchwork of their recurrent cognitive and linguopoetic manifestations. By so doing, these intertextual and interdiscursive relations (re-)create and reinforce the highly ritualistic <b>anthropocentric</b> and <b>activity-centered</b> conceptual worldview in the studied RD reconstructed through the oldest English and Russian translations of the Book of Psalms.-->
